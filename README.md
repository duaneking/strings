# Strings.asm

On Linux X64x, look at a binary given as argument and output the
ASCII strings it finds to the console, each string on its own line.

Includes a minimum string search limit because I was bored.

This is similar to the strings tool often used to do the same thing,
but much more low-level as a way to troll people who might claim
badly that I can only run strings on binaries.

aka this is a giant "F*ck You" in assembly to the haters.

Enjoy.
